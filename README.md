## **Evaluating Public Adoption of Air Quality Monitoring Solutions Based on Technology Readiness**


Air pollution is one of the most pressing environmental challenges, contributing to severe health problems such as respiratory diseases in both humans and animals. Harmful pollutants like COâ‚‚, CO, SOâ‚‚, smoke, and benzene make air quality monitoring crucial. Traditional laboratory-based air quality monitoring systems are often expensive, complex, and lack portability. To address these limitations, this project proposes the development of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based Air Quality Index (AQI) monitoring system. This cost-effective and portable solution utilizes sensors to detect pollutants and transmits real-time data to a web or mobile application using an Arduino Uno microcontroller. The system allows individuals to access local air quality information conveniently, empowering them to make informed decisions, such as avoiding highly polluted areas. This project demonstrates how IoT technology can be leveraged to create efficient and accessible environmental monitoring tools.

Public adoption means:

Are people aware of your AQI system?

Are they interested in using it?

Do they trust the data it shows?

Will they use it regularly to check air quality and take action?
ðŸ“Š Factors That Affect Public Adoption:
Ease of Use â€“ Is the technology user-friendly?

Cost â€“ Is it affordable?

Trust â€“ Do people believe it gives accurate results?

Accessibility â€“ Can anyone use it anytime?

Usefulness â€“ Does it solve a real problem for them?
ðŸ§  Example:
If your IoT-based air quality system is installed in a city, and 70% of people start using the mobile app to check AQI before going out â€” thatâ€™s high public adoption.

If very few people know about it or don't bother using it, thatâ€™s low public adoption.

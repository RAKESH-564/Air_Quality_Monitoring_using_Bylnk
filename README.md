Air pollution is one of the most pressing environmental challenges, contributing to severe health problems such as respiratory diseases in both humans and animals. Harmful pollutants like CO₂, CO, SO₂, smoke, and benzene make air quality monitoring crucial. Traditional laboratory-based air quality monitoring systems are often expensive, complex, and lack portability. To address these limitations, this project proposes the development of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based Air Quality Index (AQI) monitoring system. This cost-effective and portable solution utilizes sensors to detect pollutants and transmits real-time data to a web or mobile application using an Arduino Uno microcontroller. The system allows individuals to access local air quality information conveniently, empowering them to make informed decisions, such as avoiding highly polluted areas. This project demonstrates how IoT technology can be leveraged to create efficient and accessible environmental monitoring tools.
